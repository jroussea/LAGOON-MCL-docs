============

LArGe cOmparative Omic Network - Markov CLustering (LAGOON-MCL) is 
a FAIR workflow that uses `NextFlow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`_ 
as a workflow manager. The objective of this pipeline is to able to 
construct Putative Protein Family (cluster) using `Markov CLustering 
algorithm <https://github.com/micans/mcl>`_ and pairwise alignments 
obtained with `Diamond <https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond>`_.

LAGOON-MCL is a new version of `LAGOON <https://github.com/Dylkln
/LAGOON.git>`_ developped by Dylan Klein.
